>  ### [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.




### [Demo](https://nuxt-realworld.netlify.app/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)




This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.



We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)** community styleguides & best practices.
